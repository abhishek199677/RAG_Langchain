Early Life and the Value of Compassion

Born in a small town in Rajasthan, India, to a family with limited means, Abhishek childhood was marked by illness in the family and scarce medical resources. he realized early on that access to healthcare could change lives.

Despite financial and social hurdles, Priya excelled in academics and earned a scholarship to study medicine. Her experiences as a doctor in rural clinics shaped her understanding of systemic healthcare challenges.

MediBridge quickly gained recognition for its low-cost telemedicine services and community outreach. In 2020, the company raised $4 million from a leading healthcare VC, enabling it to expand across Asia and Africa.
